# dice-game
Dice game written in vanilla JavaScript.

At the start of the game the player is selected randomly. Each player has to roll the dice. At which point they have the option to either add the dice score to the temporary bank and keep rolling the dice or end the session whereby control will be given to the other player. Once a player ends a session the temporary bank gets added to the permanent bank.

The first player to have a score of 100 or over wins the game.

But things are not that simple. If a player rolls a 1 then whatever they had accumulated in the temporary bank gets wiped out and control passes to the other player.
